# Urban Scooter

**Project Overview:**

Urban Scooters provides a dynamic rental scooter service through two distinct platforms: a user-friendly web application that enables customers to easily rent scooters, and a dedicated Android mobile application designed for couriers to efficiently manage and accept delivery requests. 

To ensure the highest standards of quality and performance, the Urban Scooters application suite underwent extensive testing across various dimensions, including manual quality assurance (QA), API, mobile, and database testing. The use of Chrome DevTools was pivotal in debugging and optimizing the web application, highlighting its importance in the development process. 

Throughout the testing phase, a suite of tools was employed to facilitate effective analysis and design of test cases. JIRA was utilized for tracking bugs and managing project tasks, ensuring a smooth workflow and timely resolution of issues. Google Workspace provided a collaborative environment for team communication and document management. Postman was a key tool in testing and validating API functionality, while Android Studio was essential for developing and testing the mobile application. Additionally, Miro served as an invaluable resource for visualizing workflows and designing test cases, aiding in the comprehensive testing strategy that underpinned the success of the Urban Scooters applications.

**Your Role and Contributions:**

In my role as a QA engineer, my responsibilities included:
- Performed detailed cross-browser manual testing of the scooter rental web application, focusing on user interactions such as renting and tracking orders. This process involved validating data inputs to confirm compliance with design specifications.
- Created a range of test artifacts and documents, improving the depth and scope of testing analyses.
- Undertook extensive mobile testing on the courier delivery application to improve its functional performance.
- Employed Postman for backend API testing, carefully verifying outcomes through database access and analysis.
- Confirmed the accuracy of API test outcomes by executing SQL queries on the database through remote server access.

**Testing Approach:**

Functional system testing was extensively conducted on the web application, with a strong reliance on the developed test cases. These test cases were crafted using black-box testing methods, particularly emphasizing equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis to cover both positive and negative test scenarios.

In the realm of API testing, the emphasis was on ensuring data integrity by verifying that both the data structure and format met the expected standards. Black-box testing methodologies were employed here as well, to validate the data effectively.

For mobile testing, the focus was primarily on assessing the functional aspects of the application. This involved leveraging the capabilities of Android Studio, including the use of its emulator for testing the APK and analyzing logs to ensure smooth operation.
